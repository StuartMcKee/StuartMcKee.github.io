            Welcome to the new-project-survival-guide, written by developers for developers. Here to inform you off all the little things that can make joining a new project a challenge!

            We keep this guide up-to-date and open to anyone who wishes to contribute, so if there's something you've recently discovered or have an experience you wish to share, don't be afraid to share it with us!

          <h2>Your First Day</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to your first day on your new project.<br> Think of it like trying to start a new diet or exercise routine, you're not going to be able to do everything from the get go. So relax and get to know as many people as you can on the project, it's likely that you'll be here for a few months at least...
          </p>

          <p>
            Ok so you're in, you've got to know some people, you might even have some tasks to get on with, great! It's likely you'll be keen to prove yourself by delievering a large piece of work in a short time and we admire your enthusiam. However don't neglect your surroundings especially on a customer site...

          <h2>Travel</h2>
          <p>
            Lucky you, you're on a project that requires travel, we mean has the <i>benefit</i> of travel! Not everyone likes travel and that's fine but to be honest it's a pretty sweet deal when you factor in the financail rewards which we'll cover here. If you're new to travel don't worry we'll cover everything from packing to airport systems...

        <h2>Your First Day</h2>
        <p>
          ...A few months at least. Yes at least, you could be on your new project for quite some time which making it important for you to get to know on the project. It might sound a little cheesey but these people are essentailly going to be your family for as long as you're there. 
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well what if I don't get along with people on my project?" <br>
          Let me ask you something, do you get along with everyone in your family?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do, good for you! Then you can also learn to get along with those on your project.
          It's more important than just getting along with your peers, if you don't feel part of the team you're less likely to communicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're all aware of how important communication is within projects the evidence is all around you, that's why in Agile projects we have daily stand-ups to encourage cross project communication, it's why we have tools like Yammer for knowledge sharing, Lync and for some HipChat for direct or group communication across site/office and that's just naming some of the communication techniques we use. So please, for your first day make sure you're doing everything you can to break down any communication barriers. We also recommend to eat lunch with your team if possible.
        </p>
        <h3>- Next steps - Project Overview, Dev Environment</h3>
        <p>
          We understand that it's important for you to get up to speed with the current technology stack used in your project, but remember, it's your first day on the project. Before you worry about that you should take a step back and look at the project overview and artictecture documentation of the system, how everything plugs together.<br>
          Where is it? That depends on your project, use your words, go ask someone in the dev team!
          Keep in mind you're not going to absorb everything about the project or the architecture on your first day but it will give you some idea of the scale of the project. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Done that? Cool, get your development environment set-up, download the source of the project and take a look at story US129313131.
        </p>
        <p>
          HA! If it were only that simple... Every project is different, some projects have well maintained project wiki's which guide you through step-by-step how to get everything set-up. Unfortunatly some don't, which can make this step particularly painful but if it doesn't, congratulations! You just identified the first major improvement you can make to the project - setting up is harder than it should be. Work with another developer to get set up and document everything you did to get up and running and use that to create a project wiki! If you're lucky then you'll have your development environment up and running by the end of the first day, it's a big if though so don't be surprised if you have to pick this up tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alright so day 1 is over, you made it, you got to know your team, a little about the project you'll be working on and you might even know some of the architecture of the project. If you've got your development environment up and running you've done pretty damn well for day 1!
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: This site is updated by developers like you, so if your first day was completely different we want to know!<br>

      <div id="Observation">
        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>
          It's very easy to get tunnel vision on your tasks and neglect the bigger picture. Observe your surroundings, we don't mean take a 15 minute break to look out the window, here's what you should keep your eye out for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>How people interact within your project</strong>, this will give you important information on how to conduct yourself within your work environment whether that be dresscode, attitude, office hours etc. It will also help you identify who the bigger players are within the project. When on client site this is extremely important, the last thing you want to do when you're new is cause an upset with the client by doing something inappropraite, they should be happy you've just joined!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Moods</strong>, we've all heard the saying of "there's a time and a place" go ahead and add mood on there too. On a normal day most people are happy to answer the small questions you might have and since you're new you'll probably have a lot. However everyone has work to do and in our line of work pressure comes with the job, so pick your moment carefully and ask yourself, "Can I answer this myself?" before disturbing someones chain of thought.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What others are working on</strong>, we're really fortunate that the majority of our projects are interesting, this means that there's a lot of interesting work. <br>
            You hear developers in your project discussing something? -You should get in on that, even if you have nothing to contribute it's all building up your wider knowledge of the project. You have visibility of what everyone is working on, use that information. <br>
            You see an interesting task? -Don't be afraid to take a few minutes to chat to the developer that's working on it. The worst that can happen is you learn something!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you're new on a project good observation can get you up to speed with a wide range of important aspects of the project. The best part is that you can do it while you're working, it's not something you have to actively do, just something that you should be concious of while you work.
        </p>
        <p>
          So keep your head up, it's good for your posture too!

        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this section was to <strong>change your mind</strong> about travel. There's a few famous quotes about trying to change someones mind, apparently it's one of the hardest things to do. If you're really against travel there's not much here we can really say to change that so here's the facts:

        <h3>Money</h3>
        <p>
          Some people like money, if you're one of those people just take a look at some of the financail rewards travelling can offer:
